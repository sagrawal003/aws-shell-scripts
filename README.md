# preserve-application-log-to-s3
### This script is useful for taking back up any file basically logs file from application server to s3 so that even if server crashes or if server set under auto deployment to kill old servers and create new servers cloned by old server then log will be backed up to s3 for future reference and does not get lost with server crash or kill.
